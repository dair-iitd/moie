We have a Colab script that includes the commands for running inference on pre-trained models and training the models from scratch.
The Colab link will be visible after submitting this form: [Google Form](https://forms.gle/z8HETfUgbbwAQBFZ6).
It is a very light-weight form that will help us guide future improvements to the system. 
Your cooperation is highly appreciated!
